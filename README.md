Explorations into Data Journalism - updated as possible.

## 3-30-2021 

[//]: # (Just started this data journal as we are beginning a Zoom meeting about scholarships. Want to see if this helps me figure out what system to use to keep data organized and present visually. It's now 15:43 and there's no solution for half of these scholarships and people are spending more time digging into secondary bullshit and not the issue at hand. And now a certain faculty member brings up the inevitable "we wuz robbed" angle.)

[//]: # (Have to be careful because this form of commenting doesn't follow the return.)

[//]: # (It's pretty obvious that I've been shut out of the decision-making, as every time I have tried to speak, someone has talked over me. And I'm tired of trying to fight to get my voice in edgewise. I'm just going to work with my students and do my classes and union stuff and separate myself from the rest of the department, because none of these people is at all interested in getting things done.)
