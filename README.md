Explorations into Data Journalism - updated as possible.

[//]: # (Just started this data journal as we are beginning a Zoom meeting about scholarships. Want to see if this helps me figure out what system to use to keep data organized and present visually. It's now 15:43 and there's no solution for half of these scholarships and people are spending more time digging into secondary bullshit and not the issue at hand. And now a certain faculty member brings up the inevitable "we wuz robbed" angle.)
