Explorations into Data Journalism - updated as possible.

[//]: # (Just started this data journal as we are beginning a Zoom meeting about scholarships. Want to see if this helps me figure out what system to use to keep data organized and present visually. It's now 15:43 and there's no solution for half of these scholarships and people are spending more time digging into secondary bullshit and not the issue at hand. And now a certain faculty member brings up the inevitable "we wuz robbed" angle.)

[//]: # (Have to be careful because this form of commenting doesn't follow the return.)

[//]: # (It's pretty obvious that I've been shut out of the decision-making, as every time I have tried to speak, someone has talked over me. And I'm tired of trying to fight to get my voice in edgewise. I'm just going to work with my students and do my classes and union stuff and separate myself from the rest of the department, because none of these people is at all interested in getting things done.)

Dialogue mapping: 

Dialogue maps help teams and organizations collaborate and deliberate on complicated issues more effectively by facilitating a discussion that breaks down each issue and idea. In other words, dialogue maps visualize the critical thinking process, making it easier to consider problems from every angle.

What is a “wicked problem”?
First coined by Horst Rittel and Melvin M. Webber in 1973, “wicked problems” describe problems that are hard to define and difficult to solve. Though the term originally applied to social and cultural issues, it has also been adopted in product development and other business disciplines.

Wicked problems typically share the following characteristics:

There is no definitive end or stopping point.
Solutions are good or bad, rather than true or false.
There is no formula for solving a wicked problem.
Each problem is unique.
Wicked problems are symptoms of other problems.
There are no alternative solutions.
There are multiple explanations for a problem depending on individual perspectives.
In short: Wicked problems are complex issues that don’t have one clear-cut solution.
